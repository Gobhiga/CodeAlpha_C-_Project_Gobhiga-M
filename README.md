This repository contains three C++ mini-projects completed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship Program.
Each task demonstrates different programming concepts such as loops, arrays, functions, file handling, and backtracking.

📌 Task 1: CGPA Calculator

A simple C++ program that:

Accepts number of subjects

Takes credit & grade points

Calculates SGPA/CGPA

Displays the final result


➡️ Features

User-friendly input

Grade × Credit calculation

Total credit verification

Final CGPA output

📌 Task 2: Registration Form

A C++ console-based registration form that collects user details such as:

Name

Age

Email

Mobile number

Address


➡️ Features

Validates basic inputs

Stores the data

Outputs a formatted registration summary

📌 Task 3: Sudoku Solver

A C++ program that solves any 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using Backtracking Algorithm.

➡️ Features

Solves Sudoku automatically

Prints the completed grid

Checks if the puzzle is valid

Efficient backtracking logic


🛠 How to Run the Programs

1. Install any C++ compiler

GCC / MinGW

g++

CodeBlocks

VS Code with C++ extension

2. Compile the file

g++ filename.cpp -o output


3. Run the output

./output
